Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with
dynamic semantics.
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynam
ic binding, make it
very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scri
pting or glue language
to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax
emphasizes readability
and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules
and packages, which
encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the ex
tensive standard library
are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,
and can be freely distributed.
